# Marketplace App
The Marketplace App allows users to buy and sell items.

To launch the application, make sure you are in the project folder, and enter into your terminal:

    $ heroku local -f Procfile.dev

This will initiate both the React frontend and the Rails backend simultaneously for simple startup.
